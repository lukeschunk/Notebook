## Nate Priego
* Spending more time on core systems - Insight and Target, campaign groups. You've got to get into bullseye a little
* Still wants to dive into the core stuff
* He really likes doing his own thing, but feels like collaboration would be his way into the core systems. I related to this and i'm trying to learn more about the platform, so I've just started reaching out and asking questions. Nate will try to ask more questions.
* Nate has worked with activeRemote nullify - that was really helpful for him because he was able to dive deeper into the RPC side
* Nate really thinks the way we have our platform setup is cool, and he looks forward to understanding more about it
* Nate has been reviewing more code - he takes ~30mins at the end of the day to review PRs and ask questions

## New Goals
* Nate has been consistantly late to work, and really wants to work on being on time for standup






* Longbow makes RPC calls to bullseye, there are no schema or anything in Rails apps, but that would be typical
