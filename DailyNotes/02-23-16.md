## TO Try to fix websocket_rails
* Bundle update
* Revert to master, just try updating node module/package.json
* hijacking the login process has altered the way the be


## Devise Exploring
* there's a file called `registrations_controller.rb` in devise. The Devise Repo version of this file is really quite long (50 lines+), whereas ours is about 10 lines... why?
* Brian Said: "when you add devise to a project, you are essentially adding all the stuff in from the devise gem `app/` directory to your proejct" -> This doesn't seem to be the case...
* Answer: All of those controllers exist as if they were in my project, they are registered to rails as controllers. It's not going to 'end up' in my project, it's mounted as a rails engine and is IN my project

I found this:
```
# The default HTTP method used to sign out a resource. Default is :delete.
config.sign_out_via = :delete
```
In the `devise.rb` file


Could it be this:
```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  devise_for :users, :controllers => {sessions: 'sessions', registrations: 'registrations' }
  root :to => 'devices#index'

```
In the file `routes.rb` ??

* Or try this link http://railscasts.com/episodes/210-customizing-devise?autoplay=true at about 5:40 seconds in...

* Defaults:
```
* path_names: configure different path names to overwrite defaults :sign_in, :sign_out, :sign_up,
  :password, :confirmation, :unlock.
```

* Look at RobinHood and Longbow
