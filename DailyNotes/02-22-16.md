### Gunny Notes for The Day
* I need to figure out how to display that little blue box on the front end, I think...right now it's doing it in Devise in the file: `devise.en.yml` where it has an unauthenticated message...
* Need to replace the flash notice which is in the `application.html.erb` file
* Can I put a ternary operator in the const, like this:
```javascript
  const rightLinks = [
    {
      name: (userLoggedIn ? "Account" : "Sign In")
    }
  ]
```
* Is there a way to register a click on a component that is like NOT-WIthin the component's rendered area??
* If it's a single store, use state `details` , if it's multiple, you use `items`
