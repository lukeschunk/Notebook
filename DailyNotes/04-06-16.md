Hi Michelle - I’m on the frontend team here at MX, and I’m hoping to be able to host a React (javascript framework) meetup here on April 28 at 7PM. These meetups are a really fun gathering of developers and the sponsoring party (MX, hopefully!) will provide some easy food (like pizza or jdawgs or something) for the event. 

I’ve already gotten the OK from Brandon Beeks the front end lead, and he told me to coordinate with you.
