Normal Deploy Process
* Production Release Candidates are in QA waiting to go to Production
* WA Release Candidates are our staging place where us as developers can say "i have something i want to deploy"
* :shipit: usually given by a lead or a QWA member
*  :octocat: means that you have code that you want to merge and deploy but it's not merged yet. Basically, they're waiting for their shipit in the PR. typically is used if there's already one in front of you in the QA release candidates process
* Sand is our playground as developers
* master deployed is in sand
* stable is in prod
* if you deploy to sand, post in the dev channel.
* __AS FRONT END__ WE always leave ours in PR's as the octocat. Why? Because in some of our applications it gets compiled into a Ruby Gem - ie raja and robinhood are wrapped in a ruby gem. You update the gem in the backend pioece
* If we need to test something in sand, we add a branch
* __IMPORTANT__ We never merge our PR's in until we get a shipit from QA in the qa release candidates.

### Gunny Rules
* With Gunny, you just merge it then you deploy
* Pay attention to what version of Ruby i'm using - it affects
* Use: __Jruby 9.4.02-17__

* Jruby takes ruby and compiles it down to Java. allows us to use ruby code and end up with a compiled java application. Some of the stuff we use on the backend requires java to interact with the C++ stuff. Also, it's more performant.
