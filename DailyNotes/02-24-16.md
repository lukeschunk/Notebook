## Running into "target element is not a DOM element"
* This is caused by App.js looking for an element that doesn't exist in the
current Rails View


### Ideas on How to FIX:
* Multiple Bundles - that are only included in the place where we need?
* If I put them in different orders, that depends on whether or not the app chokes
* Only Render One Big App Component like you usually do in a React, and then use logic like based on the hash to determine which components are displayed
*

### Gunny Meeting
* You can Load all the different Git Branches of the different scripts
* Interactions With Web View
* Screenshot per command
* Metrics
* Demo module
* IDE Development
* Soft Keyboard Interactions

## Afternoon Notes
* How does the current flash message decide on what to show? Is it something in Rails??
* Can you add an href to a button?
