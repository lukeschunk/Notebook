#### Process
* In order to get the component to show up individually, I required it in the App.js main React file (the one that webpack is looking at), but I didn't actually include it in the render method for the App component. This way it's available.
* Replace line 30 and above in the application file. Create a component
* __IMPORTANT THING__ we sometimes have trouble with a deploy having an incorrect bundle.
- deletes your node_modules directory
- runs `npm install`
- runs `webpack -p --progress`

```
function test() {
  return 'this test function returns a dumb string'
}
```


#### Questions Of The Day
* How do You Require Open Source Components?
Actually, it's pretty easy. You just do a normal require, and then to sepcify the component you want you can put it in brackets, ie: `const { Loader } = require('mx-react-components');`
* Eslint error when I try to lint an individual file globally. Is there a global .eslintrc file?
* Beeks mentioned doing a bunch of 'mini app.js files' and having several bundles...how would you accomplish this in webpack?
