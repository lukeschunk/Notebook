## Daily Notes
* How come when i set getInitialState `stagedScript: {}`, it registers as something when passed down to props to the devices component?
* If the script is an object that has three properties, name, id, description, you can do this: `const script = {name, id, description}`
* If you select a script that's far down in the modal, close the modal then reopen it, it should be at that spot
* When you select an option other than master from the Select component, then close the modal, that option should show up as selected when you reopen, not `Master`
