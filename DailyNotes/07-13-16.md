## Get that Other Data though
* When we create the parent categories, push one extra other category to that array - other
* When we have the 'final' data, do a quick calculation to see what 5% of the data is
* Add the category values in ascending order as long as their total < the cutoff we calculated above
* Grab those categories that were added to total, push them to the other category's children array
* remove them from the main array (since they're already in other children)
*
<!-- * if category total is less than that number^....
  * push it to the otherCategory.Children (array.length - 1)
  * Remove the parentGuid from its children (?) or something like that -->


* order from greatest to least, reverse while loop?
