## Coding Notes
* if you want a fun experiment. Pick a component and add `console.log('rendered')` to the `render` method. Then add `shouldComponentUpdate (nextProps) { return !_isEqual(this.props, nextProps); }` ...then see how many renders it prevents.


Gunny is deployed with one command:
`bundle exec treb sand deploy`



## Onboarding Notes

#### Products

###### Hydra & Platform
* We aggregate better than anybody in the industry because we have more than one sources - Hydra
* __Platform__ Three C's => Cleansing, Categorization, Classification

###### Money Desktop
* HTML5 Widgets - user interface
* Allows users to take control of their financial future
* Firefly is the service that runs this

###### Nexus API
* Two API's - reporting API and a Nexus API
* Reporting = dump of data that shows what has changed for our clients users on a daily basis
* Nexus API - Is for individual users

###### Helios & Widenet
* Helios = our cross platform framework for apps
* Widenet - financial institution app that anyone can use, it's an acquisition tool

###### Insight & Target
* Insight and target work off a colinder database which allows us to quickly search data and display it on a massive scale.

###### Obsidian
* Wealth Management Product

* Why don't other people use multiple sources?


#### Brandon Dewitt's Presentation
* We actually deliver innovation and pass all the securiiity
* Protocal Buffers = when you release hour software - ability to run tens of thousands of servers on different versions of the same
* Massively distributed self coordinated System
* Right before 10 am you see a spike on the firefly graph, on Fridays at 4 you see a spike at about double
* Many releases a day - this actually makes it easier. When code changes, it is easy to diagnose since it's a small amount of code
* Continuous Delivery = Continuous momentum = building the right thing with the right level of momentum and never have to build it again
*

##### Right now we're working
Maintanance can be super difficult.
We build for the long term
* We use style and code analysis to secure our code and to make it homogenous
* Sand, QA, Staging, Production Environments

* Watchman= sits on a server and will watch to make sure you don't ship it to production without getting it checked off

##### DevOps & Infrastructure
* Puppet =
