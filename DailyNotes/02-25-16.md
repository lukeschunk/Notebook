## Gunny stuff
* Had to add back in the require_tree . because it was creating a weird bug in the script builder.
* Making it context aware so only AFCU and generic scripts get shown for AFCU
* Wasn't sure where i should put the `constants.image`
* Look up `git cherrypick`

### Things I've Tried to Fix the LogOut Issue:
* Tried removing the Href from the actual header component and instead moving the window redirect to the `_handleUserStoreChange` method


### Notes On PR
* There has to be a better way to not render the login view then keeping the file with the comment
*
